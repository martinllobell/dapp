## Project Deployment
To deploy the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `dapp-client` folder in your terminal.
2. Run `npm i` to install the project dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Open a new terminal and navigate to the project folder.
5. Run `npx hardhat node` to start the local Hardhat node.
6. In another terminal, while in the same project folder, run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost --show-stack-traces` to compile and deploy the contracts on your local network.

And that's it! You should now have your project running locally.
